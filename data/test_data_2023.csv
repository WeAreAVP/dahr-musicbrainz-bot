He composed the scores for 11 of the <i>James Bond</i> films between 1963 and 1987, and also arranged and performed the ""James Bond Theme"" to the first film in the series, 1962's <i>Dr. No</i>. He wrote the Grammy- and Academy Award-winning scores to the films <i>Dances with Wolves</i> and <i>Out of Africa</i>, as well as the theme for the British television cult series <i>The Persuaders!</i>, in a career spanning over 50 years. In 1999, he was appointed OBE for services to music. </p><p>Born in York, Barry spent his early years working in cinemas owned by his father. During his national service with the British Army in Cyprus, Barry began performing as a musician after learning to play the trumpet. Upon completing his national service, he formed his own band in 1957, The John Barry Seven. He later developed an interest in composing and arranging music, making his début for television in 1958. He came to the notice of the makers of the first James Bond film <i>Dr. No</i>, who were dissatisfied with a theme for James Bond given to them by Monty Norman. This started a successful association between Barry and Eon Productions that lasted for 25 years. </p><p>He received many awards for his work, including five Academy Awards; two for <i>Born Free</i>, and one each for <i>The Lion in Winter</i> (for which he also won the first BAFTA Award for Best Film Music), <i>Dances with Wolves</i> and <i>Out of Africa</i> (both of which also won him Grammy Awards). He also received ten Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once for Best Original Score for <i>Out of Africa</i> in 1986. Barry completed his last film score, <i>Enigma</i>, in 2001 and recorded the successful album <i>Eternal Echoes</i> the same year. He then concentrated chiefly on live performances and co-wrote the music to the musical <i>Brighton Rock</i> in 2004 alongside Don Black. In 2001, Barry became a Fellow of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, and, in 2005, he was made a Fellow of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Barry was married four times and had four children. He moved to the United States in 1975 and lived there until his death in 2011. </p>   ","November 3, 1933",York,"January 30, 2011",Oyster Bay,https://www.discogs.com/artist/19502,,,,,,,,https://music.apple.com/artist/251072,,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n82020007,"Barry, John, 1933-2011",,,,https://musicbrainz.org/artist/661e20c8-3d82-4da2-94a2-97d9e11691c0,https://open.spotify.com/artist/7ctAOUlIAs7yuMODWE2Fyz,,http://viaf.org/viaf/76499379,,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q111074,,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barry_(composer),14,14

Lucho Bermúdez was one of the first innovators who experimented with adaptation of these local rhythms of the Colombian Caribbean, and that adapted them to the contemporary musical language of the time. His work had great impact in other countries of Latin America. Lucho Bermúdez was perhaps the main person responsible for having made cumbia and porro become standards of Colombian music internationally since the 1940s.

He played trombones and, less often, bass trumpet or euphonium, and even less often electric bass &amp; banjo.  He played the valve trombone. </p><p>Brown was little recorded, and devoted most of his career to education. He earned a music degree from New York University, as a member of the Zeta Psi Fraternity. </p><p>Marshall Brown was also a high school band director leading the Farmingdale New York 'Daler' Band from the early 1950s through 1957. Brown was the first high school band director to initiate a jazz education program, which he did in his tenure at Farmingdale High. By 1956 his stage band (jazz big band) the Daler Dance Band was so formidable and impressive (boasting future jazz stars Michael Abene on piano, Andrew Marsala, saxophone, and whiz drummer Larry Ramsden) that one night at the '57 Newport Jazz Festival, Count Basie, late for his appearance, as he entered the festival grounds heard the Daler Band performing their set and exclaimed, ""Damn, they started already"", mistaking the 'Dalers' for his band! The average age of the band members was 14! </p><p>Brown received some attention for performing in a quartet with Pee Wee Russell in the early 1960s.

He is remembered as an anti-Walpolean satirist and also as a patriot.  Several of his melodies continue to be sung today, and he was widely praised in the generation after his death.  Because he worked in anonymity, selling his own compositions to others to pass off as their own, contemporary scholarship can only be certain of some of his poetry, and a great deal of the music he composed was written for theatrical incidental music.  However, under his own name and hand, he was a prolific songwriter and balladeer, and he wrote the lyrics for almost all of these songs.  Further, he wrote numerous operas and plays.  His life is illustrative of the professional author in the early 18th century.  Without inheritance or title or governmental position, he wrote for all of the remunerative venues, and yet he also kept his own political point of view and was able to score significant points against the ministry of the day.  Further, he was one of the leading lights of the new ""Patriotic"" movement in drama.</p>",1687,London,1743,London,https://www.discogs.com/artist/931714,,,,,,0000 0001 0855 4647,http://www.isni.org/isni/0000000108554647,,,http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n80004008,"Carey, Henry, 1687?-1743",,,Henry Carey,https://musicbrainz.org/artist/ee876e05-03ad-42d2-ad77-e5feae88598d,,,http://viaf.org/viaf/14965532,VIAF: ,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1606590,Henry Carey (writer),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Carey_(writer),47,51

Kate was among the earliest recorded women in country music, and arguably her best remembered song was a rendition of her father's composition ""Little Mary Phagan"". </p><p>Carson was born the youngest of nine children in Atlanta, Georgia. As early as the age of five, she appeared as a vocalist and dancer at stage shows and political rallies as an accompaniment to her father's musical act. By age 14, Carson proficiently performed with the guitar and banjo as she played alongside her father on Atlanta's flagship radio station, WSB, and toured with him and the Virginia Reelers throughout Georgia. When Carson graduated from high school, she became a permanent member of the band.</p><p>In June 1925, Carson made her recording debut accompanying her father on guitar on four sides for OKeh Records. In the same session, she also recorded two solo efforts, ""The Lonely Child"", which was about a lonely wandering orphan, and ""Little Mary Phagan"". The somber ballad was composed by Fiddlin' Jon Carson in 1915, as a response to the notorious, and highly publicized murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, which was allegedly perpetrated by her manager, Leo Frank. She played and recorded with the Virginia Reelers until 1934, adopting the stage name Moonshine Kate in 1928 at the suggestion of Okeh Records man Polk Brockman.

In the 1930s, he attended and graduated Indiana University's School of Music. Jazz composer Hoagy Carmichael had persuaded Dant—who at that time had his own ""Bud Dant Collegians"" danceband—to come to IU to study at their School of Music.  At that time, Carmichael did not know how to read or write music. The two friends met one day in 1927 at the school's Book Nook restaurant, where Carmichael played the first several bars of a song he had conceived—a jazz chorus. He asked Dant to write an arrangement right there in the Book Nook restaurant—this was the first time the song Stardust, which at the time was called ""Star Dust,"" had ever been written down. According to Dant, the piece was originally a peppy jazz song and recorded in 1927, but in 1928, a slower version was written out by Dant and Carmichael. The piece was recorded with Carmichael and others at the Gennett Records studio in Richmond, Indiana. In 1929, Mitchell Parish wrote lyrics to the song. Stardust, an idiosyncratic melody in medium tempo, became an American standard, and is one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century, with over 1,500 total recordings. </p><p>Dant graduated Indiana and played with big bands of the 1940s in the East Coast, notably Herby Kaye, who was briefly married to Dorothy Lamour, who provided the vocals. Dant briefly conducted his own group but in 1939, Charles left his life as a bandmember in Chicago and Indiana and came to California. He had been asked by Gordon Jenkins, the head of NBC music, to orchestrate and conduct radio shows for NBC in Hollywood. He and his wife Nell and children Christopher and Susan settled in Beverly Hills in 1938. During this period, Dant became the musical director for NBC. He spent many years composing and conducting the music for radio and TV with such people as Jack Carson, Dennis Day, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, Bob Hope, Julie Andrews, Cliff Arquette, Phil Harris, Bing Crosby, Hoagy Carmichael, Judy Canova, and more Artists. He also wrote and orchestrated music for movies. He conducted the orchestra for the Colgate Comedy Hour on TV. Later in his career, Dant recorded for Decca Records, which he joined in 1955 as producer. </p><p>While at Decca, Dant also discovered a talented clarinet player at The Lawrence Welk Show, Pete Fountain, and recorded 42 hit albums with him. He also recorded many albums with Ricky Nelson, Teresa Brewer, Earl Grant, and several others. His albums are still sold today. He wrote and recorded 60 albums, including The Unicorn (single #32254) with The Irish Rovers in 1968. Charles Dant was awarded several gold records for this recording in 1968. He served as executive producer of William Shatner's notorious 1968 album ""The Transformed Man"" (DL 75043). </p><p>Dant continued with Decca-Coral until the 1970s, when he moved to Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. There, he succeeded Webley Edwards, founder of ""Hawaii Calls""—the longtime Hawaiian music radio show. He produced albums by Hawaii performers, including music composed by Alex Anderson and songs sung by Alfred Apaka and Melveen Leed. Dant belonged to St. Michael's Catholic Church and was band leader at Hulihee Palace.
